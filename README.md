# To Do App

This to do app is a simple yet attractive app that lets you keep track of your tasks without having to rewrite every time you close the window. The tasks are saved as either completed (check and strikethrough) or not yet complete (circle waiting to be checked). All items can be removed by selecting the 'X' to the right.
